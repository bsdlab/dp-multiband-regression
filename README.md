# ECOG Multiband regression decoding

This module uses a decoding approach on ECOG data which will calculate the
bandpower for bands defined in `./configs/decoder_config.toml` and combines them
according to a trained model stored in `./configs/model.joblib`.

# Training the model

This will be included in this module at a later point.
